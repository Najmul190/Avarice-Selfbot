# Usage

Avarice's selfbot will be set by you when you first run it, and will also ask for your Discord token which obviously is used to connect to your account. Your token does not leave the `config.json` and will not ever be sent to me. Use your prefix followed by the command to execute it. Here are the categories of commands, run them to view the commands in each category:

- `moderation` - View moderation commands
- `utilities` - View utility commands
- `tools` - View general tools that are to make your life easier and make using Discord more convenient
- `troll` - View commands designed to troll and annoy people while humorously entertaining yourself
- `fun` - View commands designed for fun and entertainment
- `nsfw` - View NSFW commands
- `text` - View text commands, such as encryptions and emojifications
- `animated` - View animated text commands
- `settings` - View settings commands, used to configure the selfbot
- `avarice` - Shows information about the selfbot

Please note that some commands may require certain permissions or have restrictions. Use commands responsibly and at your own risk.

# Installation

Using this selfbot is incredibly simple and requires no knowledge of any coding. Simply download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Najmul190/Avarice-Selfbot/releases/) and extract the zip file and run `Avarice.exe` which will help you setup.

It may trigger your anti-virus due to the way I converted the Python file into an executable using pyinstaller, but it is completely safe and is a false-positive. If you know how to fix this please tell me as I have no clue as to why it's seen as a virus.

## Manual Installation (Using Source Code)

If you don't feel like using `Avarice.exe` to setup the selfbot, you can manually install it. This is also simple but with a few more added steps.

1. Ensure you have the latest Python installed and then download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Najmul190/Avarice-Selfbot/releases/) by clicking on the `Source Code (zip)` button.
2. Extract the zip file and open the folder.
3. If you're on windows, you can simply run `run.bat` to install the dependencies and also get the selfbot running. If you're on linux you'll have to follow the steps below.
4. You can always repeat step 3 to turn on the selfbot.

If you want to run the selfbot even more manually than this, you can install the dependencies yourself. You can install them by running `python3 -m venv bot-env` and then `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory of the selfbot. You can then run the selfbot by running `python3 main.py` in the directory of the selfbot.
